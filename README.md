# Egg Catcher Game
This is a simple Egg Catcher game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to catch falling eggs using a basket controlled by either keyboard keys or mouse movement. The game keeps track of the score, lives remaining, and the speed of the falling eggs. The game ends when all lives are lost, and the player has the option to replay or quit.

#### Game Controls:
The player can choose between two control options:
- Keys Control: The basket is moved using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.
- Mouse Control: The basket follows the horizontal movement of the mouse.

#### How to Run the Game:
To run the game, follow these steps:
- Install Python on your computer if it's not already installed.
- Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal: pip install pygame.
- Download the "egg_catcher.py" file from the GitHub repository.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the "egg_catcher.py" file is located.
- Run the game by executing the command: python egg_catcher.py.
- The game window will open, and you can start playing!

#### Game Rules:
- Move the basket left and right to catch the falling eggs.
- Each caught egg earns you one point.
- If an egg reaches the bottom of the screen without being caught, you lose one life.
- The game ends when you run out of lives.
- Every 5 eggs caught, the speed of the falling eggs increases.
- You can pause the game by pressing the 'P' key.

#### Game Over and Replay

- Replay: Press the 'R' key to reset the game and play again.
- Quit: Press the 'Q' key or close the game window to exit the game.
